                                Tidal forces strip stars from the progenitor via its L1 and L2 Lagrange points, leading to the creation of 
                                stellar stars. The KRIOS code is able to reproduce the characteristics of
                                these streams to a satisfactory degree. We had to slightly modify NBODY6++GPU to resolve some issues with the current version of
                                the code, which fails when using MWPotential2014. We refer to the fork of the code available at KerwannTEP/Nbody6ppGPU.

                                We use the KRIOS code to study the benefits of breaking spherical symmetry and how it relates to modeling the long-term evolution of a globular cluster (GC) in a
                                host galaxy potential. Each GC is evolved forward via a combination of the self-consistent field method and
                                Hénon-style two-body relaxation. Using analytic potential models for the Milky Way, we compare the stellar
                                streams modeled with KRIOS to NBODY6++GPU and particle-spray codes in order to determine its ability to
                                reproduce observables. KRIOS force calculations scale linearly with N, thus producing stream models orders-
                                of-magnitude faster than NBODY6++GPU for hundreds of thousands of particles. KRIOS outperforms a leading particle-spray code (Chen & al. 2025) in
                                replicating sky-plane information as well, rendering it a suitable intermediary between these two popular approaches. 
                                We find particle-spray streams have more varied density, velocity dispersion, and disagreement angle
                                profiles than KRIOS, but their performance can be improved with better progenitor models and reducing Poisson noise.

                                between slowly rotating saddle modes and rapidly rotating spiral modes occurs. 
                                For models rounders than c/a = 0.2, the cluster are either stables or subject to 
                                the latter instability. Such clusters behave much differently than the Maclaurin

                                We computed the 
                                linear response of flattened Stäckel systems in rotation. Axial symmetry 
                                allowed us to decompose the response matrix into 
                                distinct azimuthal components. 
                                Two families of fast and slow bi-symmetric modes were found: the 
                                bending modes, 
                                which are saddle-shaped, and the bar-growing modes, which are spiral 
                                shaped. We showed the existence of a clear transition w.r.t. rotation 
                                between these regimes for highly-flattened clusters. We denoted a 
                                steep increase of the growth rate as one considers more flattened 
                                clusters. Conversely, flattened systems tend to become more and more 
                                stable as they become rounder for any rotation parameters. In 
                                particular, clusters below their maximally available rotation become 
                                completely stable at finite flattening, while the maximally rotating 
                                clusters become stable in the isotropic spherical limit.
                                Our predictions match N-body simulations at the ∼10% level in terms of growth 
                                rates, pattern speeds, and shapes.

                                Globular clusters are also subject to orbital diffusion induced by shot noise 
                                fluctuations driven by the finite number of stars within. This process is described 
                                by the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation via Chandrasekhar's theory. 
                                We extended this formalism from isotropic to anisotropic clusters, and provided 
                                an numerical implementation of the diffusion coefficients in Julia. Then, we studied 
                                the impact of velocity anisotropy on the rate of change of the stellar DF. We

                                as well as the isotropisation process of the cluster.

                                We investigated the long-term relaxation of rotating, spherically symmetric 
                                globular clusters through an extension of the orbit-averaged
                                Chandrasekhar formalism, which we compared to predictions to a set of N-body 
                                simulations, up to core collapse. We found the impact of rotation on in-plane relaxation
                                to be weak, with a clear match between theoretical 
                                predictions and N-body measurements. We found no strong gravo-gyro catastrophe 
                                accelerating core collapse for stable rotating clusters. Both kinetic theory and
                                simulations predict a reshuffling of orbital inclinations from overpopulated 
                                regions to underpopulated ones. This trend accelerates
                                as the amount of rotation is increased. Yet, for orbits closer to the rotational 
                                plane, the non-resonant prediction does not reproduce
                                numerical measurements. This mismatch may from these orbits’ 
                                coherent interactions, which are not captured by the
                                non-resonant formalism that only addresses local deflections.

                                both relativistic effects and the cluster’s mass. Hence the nuclear 
                                cluster is subject to orbital distortions, which can be described 
                                through the inhomogeneous Balescu-Lenard equation.
                                We applied this framework to the S-cluster of the Galactic 
                                centre in order to probe the presence of intermediate mass black

                                We modeled the NewHorizon galaxies as a thin self-gravitating gas disk, a central spherical bulge
                                and a spherical dark matter halo. This system is described by the Euler-Poisson equations, which upon linearization yields an eigenmode problem. 
                                I used the matrix method to translate this linear problem into an infinite matrix eigenvalues problem, which allowed me to recover the growth modes by 
                                truncation. Using this efficient framework, we were able to extensively explore for the first time a large portion of the parameters describing thin galactic disks 
                                (bulge fraction, dark halo, etc...) in order to explain the low bar formation rate observed in the NewHorizon simulation. 
                                We showed that discs are too light and too bulgy to grow bars, which strongly suggests that the efficiency of star
                                formation and the accretion history in cosmological simulations must be revisited to accommodate for smaller bulges and/or more massive stellar discs, 
                                hence allowing galaxies to grow bars.

                                Fastest growth mode drives bar formation. Here, darker colors translate to faster 
                            growth mode. The left part of the plot corresponds to bulge-less galaxies and the 
                            higher part of the plot corresponds to halo-less galaxies. The galaxy symbols 
                            represent the typical galaxy of the NewHorizon simulation: the filled galaxy 
                            symbol corresponds to a galaxy that has formed a bar in the simulation, while the 
                            fainter symbols represent galaxy which have not. The white region corresponds to 
                            parameters for which the growth time exceeds 10 dynamical times.
